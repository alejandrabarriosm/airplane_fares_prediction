**Overview**

The dataset contains real data collected between 1996 and 1997. It provides a rich dataset of 638 observations regarding information about the routes like distance, number of passangers, starting city, ending city, 
average number of coupons provided, if the route is a vacation route, average passanger's income, average fare of the route. That information will be used to build a model to predict the the airplane fare.

**Sections**

The project is composed by several sections:

- Section 1 – Data Preparation and Exploration: in this section some variables were converted into Dummy variables and it was created a correlation table, heat map, and scatterplot matrix.

- Section 2 – Variable Reduction Techniques: it was conducted a PCA Analysis.

- Section 3 – Linear Regressions: it was performed a full regression, forward regression, and backward regression that predict the fare.
